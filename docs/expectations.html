<p>People in the Applied Ecology Lab are expected to be good citizens, neighbors, and office/lab mates. Please try your best to act in a manner consistent with our <a href="https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Mark’s role<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#marks-role"><i class="fas fa-link"></i></a>
</h2>
<p>Mark is here to serve as a mentor and source of information about academics, research, service, and life in general. He will do his best to help everyone get the most out of their experience at SAFS and UW. As such, Mark will push you to be your best self, which may include some uncomfortable conversations on occasion. Maintaining open and clear lines of communication will be paramount to our successful mentor/mentee relationship, and Mark believes strongly that students, postdocs, and technicians should feel empowered to openly express their feelings.</p>
<p>Mark also recognizes that his socio-economic background and upbringing have shielded him from many of the challenges and injustices that others may face. Although Mark is committed to helping you find the resources and information you need, he’s also cisgendered, straight, white, which means some of you may want to seek advice from others inside or outside of SAFS. If you should choose to do so, you are under no obligation to tell Mark about it.</p>

<li><p>Mark will help you select a thesis topic and plan your research, which includes advice on possible supervisory committee members and courses that will help you now as well as in your future career.</p></li>

<p>Graduate school should be a rewarding experience, but it can be incredibly challenging at times. The resources provided here are meant to help you transition to a new phase in your life and get the most out of your time at the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. Staying organized with respect to your personal obligations, coursework, research, and outreach will help you through the process.</p>
<p>As a new graduate student in our lab, you will be welcomed into a group of diverse individuals with varying interests. We support each other in our respective endeavors and celebrate our successes. You will have numerous opportunities to contribute to our research projects, develop lasting bonds to others within and outside the lab, and help us improve upon our ways.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You will maintain a high level of professionalism, which includes acting ethically and behaving in a manner consistent with our lab’s <a href="https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> and the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html">UW Student Conduct Code</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>You will ask Mark for clarification on anything that is unclear or confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>You will know the requirements of your degree program, including important milestones such as coursework, committee formation, and proposal submission.</p></li>
<li><p>You will attend all relevant meetings and seminars, including lab meetings and one-on-one meetings with Mark.</p></li>
<li><p>You will come prepared to any meetings we have, which includes a clear idea of the agenda or goals for the meeting.</p></li>
<li><p>You will keep careful notes of your research and ensure that you research data and software is backed up.</p></li>

<p>Post-docs in our lab conduct independent research and serve as <em>ad hoc</em> advisors to undergraduate and graduate students. They are a useful source of information and can help students navigate difficult situations.</p>
<p>More info coming soon.</p>

<p>Everyone is expected to finish their tasks on time, but there are no fixed hours when people are expected to be working in the office, lab, or remote location. That said, there will indeed be times when you are expected to be somewhere at a certain time, whether it be for a meeting, seminar, or lab/field work. Please be considerate of other people’s time and do not make them wait for you or wonder where you are. If something should come up, please contact others to let them know your status.</p>
<p>In general, Mark tries to maintain core hours at SAFS from 10:00-4:00 each weekday, so that people can interact with him on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis. When Mark knows he will be away due to travel or other business, he will do his best to alert the lab prior to his absence. If you cannot find Mark in his office, please send him a message via Slack, email, or text message (if urgent or an emergency).</p>
<p>If you are funded as an RA or TA, you are expected to work on the research program funding you, or the class to which you have been assigned, for 20 hours per week. You are expected to spend another 20 hours per week working on your own research, coursework, outreach, etc. “Side projects” are encouraged, but they should be considered part of your own 20 hours of research/studies, and not your RA or TA responsibilities. Your highest priorities are completing the tasks related to your TA/RA work and making progress towards completing your degree.</p>
