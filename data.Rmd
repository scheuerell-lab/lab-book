# Data management

Data management is one of the most important aspects of our research program. In particular, when we are collecting our own data we must ensure that we 

1) include the necessary metadata to describe the individual fields in a data file; and

2) create backups of the data and metadata files.


# Data files & formats

We ascribe to the "tidy" format for data, wherein each row of a data table or flat file is a unique record and each column is a unique field. [Broman and Woo (2018)](resources/Broman_Woo_2018_spreadsheet_data.pdf) provide an excellent overview of data entry and organization in spreadsheets. Here are their major take-home messages:

1) **Be consistent**. This includes names of locations, species, sex, as well as dates and file names.

2) **Choose good names**. Choose short, but descriptive names for files and avoid spaces in them. For example, `L_WA_limno_sampling.csv` rather than `Lake Washington limnology sampling.csv`.

3) **Write dates as `YYYY-MM-DD`**. This may sound trivial, but it turns out to be really important when working with the file as part of an analysis.

4) **Don't leave empty cells**. Although it can be tempting to do so when some aspect of a field or record is to be repeated many times, it can wreak havoc on the resulting object when imported into a software like **R**. In particular, if a cell should be consider empty or null, please enter `NA`.

5) **Only include one piece of info in a cell**. For example, you might consider a variable (column) named `plot_sample`, which would be better separated into 2 columns labeled `plot` and `sample`.

6) 

**Create a data dictionary**.
