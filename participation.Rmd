# Participation


## Mentoring meetings

Every student is expected to set up regular mentoring meetings with Mark, which occur either every week or every other week, depending on the needs of the student. These meetings are usually scheduled for one hour, but the day and time may change to reflect changes in student coursework, committee meetings, etc. Students should come prepared to discuss goals and/or problems they're having with field/lab work, analyses, personnel, etc.

## Lab meetings

Attendance and participation at lab meetings is mandatory. If you are unable to attend, please notify Mark in advance. We currently meet every two weeks via Zoom.
