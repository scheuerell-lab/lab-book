## General etiquette and advice

-	When taking new volunteers out to help on your project, it’s helpful to give them a list of things they should bring and/or a packing guide. Oftentimes new volunteers are stepping out of their comfort zone, and may or may not know what to bring or how to dress. For example: If you’re expecting rain and it’s going to be very cold, make sure to highlight the warm clothes etc they should bring. Don’t assume they will know what to bring.

-	Keep an eye on each other and make sure everyone is doing ok, feeling ok, and is being safe. If you’re in charge of undergrads or other volunteers, make sure to take group breaks where people are drinking water, keeping their blood sugar up, and not overexerting themselves.

-	Fieldwork can be intense, and the group dynamic is important in making sure things go smoothly. Try to make sure everyone feels included and comfortable around each other. This can go a long way to making the trip a success.

-	Find time to have fun and unwind.
