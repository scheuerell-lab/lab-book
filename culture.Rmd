### We focus on what is best for all of us {-}

Our lab is meant to be a safe and welcoming place. We'll all have greater success in our endeavors, and feel better while doing it, when we focus on our collective good. We ask one another for help when needed and we graciously help each other when we can.


### We embrace diversity {-}

We all come from different places and different backgrounds, and we respect that not everyone has to look, feel, or act the same. We all have unique experiences and knowledge that we may, or may not, want to share with one another.


### We listen with intent to understand {-}

When we communicate with others, we listen with the intent to understand where others are coming from, and how their previous experiences shape their beliefs. We are active listeners and approach conversations with an open mind.


### We consider the impact of our intent {-}

Although we may set out with the best intentions, our words and actions may have unintended consequences. Thus, we try our best to consider the impact of our intent, with the understanding that we can also try to repair any damage we may have unwillingly caused to others.


### We learn from our mistakes {-}

We acknowledge our mistakes and try our best to learn from them. Rather than beat ourselves up about it, we take the time to understand what happened, think about how it could be rectified and avoided in the future, and move forward.


### We are open to change {-}

We acknowledge that we are always learning and looking for better ways of doing our work. As such, we accept *constructive* and *gracious* criticism from one another in the hope of improving ourselves.


### We show out {-}

We don't merely show up---we show out! We put our best selves forward and commit to working hard.


### We celebrate our successes {-}

Science has its ups and its downs. It's important that we acknowledge and celebrate our successes, whether they be small wins or major accomplishments.


### We embrace life outside of academia {-}

We believe that a healthy lifestyle outside of academia helps us be better scientists, as well as better colleagues and friends to one another. Our families, friends, pets, neighbors, and communities are important to us and they deserve some of our attention as well.
