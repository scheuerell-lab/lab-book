# SAFS Degree Requirements and Planning

The aim of this document is to consolidate the most important resources for navigating the various SAFS milestones/protocols/procedures, such as the submitting a plan of study, master's bypass process, coursework requirements, proposals, committee forming, qualifying and general exams, and more. Most of the resources here have been adapted/summarized from the [SAFS grad guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQ3umutJ-blRtPOR26a7k8mY5Hj8j4NqiFZY8rjmKWEQgdgykZAdIfZdTNzUiu7xw/pub). A more detailed description of most of these processes/protocols/requirements can be found there.

## Required coursework

Note: If you feel that prior courses that you have taken would satisfy any core requirements (or any other courses), you can waive these courses (with Mark's permission).

### Core coursework for both M.S. and Ph.D. students
- Q SCI 482 (Statistical Inference) - 5 credits
- 5-TEEN (FISH 510-514) x 2 - 2-5 credits each
- FISH 521 (Research Proposal Writing) - 4 credits
- FISH 522 (Hot Topics in Aquatic and Fishery Sciences)

### M.S.
- Minimum of 45 credits total at the 400-level or higher
- At least 18 credits must be in courses numbered 500 and above
- 18 credits must be numerically graded in department approved 400-level courses accepted as part of the major and in 500-level courses 
- Minimum of 27 non thesis credits

### Ph.D.
- Minimum of 90 credits total at the 400-level or higher
- At least 18 credits of course work at the 500 level and above
- Numerical grades must be received in at least 18 quarter credits of course work
- The Candidate must register for a minimum of 27 credits of dissertation over a period of at least three quarters

## Forming a committee
- This is typically the first milestone for both M.S. and Ph.D. students. The SAFS grad guide states that this is generally done in the 1st to 5th quarter of a degree; a typical time seems to be the summer or fall quarter after your first year.
- Your first committee meeting typically occurs shortly after committee formation and is where you go over your plan of study (see below)

### M.S. Committee
- M.S. committee is 3 members minimum: PI (Mark) + two other people
- minimum of two members must be SAFS core faculty; this means that of the two people who aren't your PI, one can be non-SAFS core faculty.

### Ph.D. Committee
- Ph.D. committee is 4 members minimum
  - Mark
  - GSR (Graduate School Representative) - this is a faculty member from UW but outside of SAFS
  - Two other people
- minimum of two members must be SAFS core faculty

## Plan of Study

This is an agreement made between the student and the supervisory committee about what coursework will be required to complete the doctoral degree. It includes the core required courses as well as any other courses the committee feels are necessary to give the student the required background in his/her/their area of interest.

## M.S. Thesis Proposal
- After forming your committee (and submitting your plan of study), this is the next major milestone for both M.S. and Ph.D. students. The SAFS grad guide states that this is generally done in the 1st to 6th quarter of a degree but I have not heard of anyone completing this in their first year. Most students complete this in their second year.
- NOTE: Even if you plan on doing the by-pass, you still must complete an M.S. thesis proposal! More detail on this later in the by-pass section.

## Dissertation Proposal
- For those entering as Ph.D. students, this is the only proposal you need to write. For those who entered as M.S. students and wish to bypass, this happens once you have completed the by-pass (and therefore means you first must have finished your M.S. thesis proposal. 

## By-pass

The M.S. by-pass procedure is one of the most frequently asked about and confusing processing at SAFS. Here are the requirements from the SAFS grad guide:


### Requirements:
- All M.S. coursework must be completed
- A statement from the student that describes their current M.S. research and illustrates the scientific direction and rationale they will take in expanding it to merit Doctoral status.  The statement should also include a plan for coursework that supports their Doctoral degree, while also satisfying program requirements, as well as a funding plan.
- A statement from the Master’s committee chairperson confirming:
  - that the student’s research has progressed to the point of demonstrating competence at the Master’s level
  - the completed M.S. research is a considerable and meaningful base of work for the proposed Ph.D. research, and, the proposed Ph.D. research is a substantive and logical advance from the M.S. research; evidence for this should be outlined in the draft Doctoral dissertation proposal
  - guaranteeing space and financial support for the student for at least the first academic year of Doctoral study; and
  - their approval of the draft Doctoral proposal.
- Current CV or resume;
- UW transcript (unofficial);
- A letter or email (to safs@uw.edu) from each member of the student's MS Supervisory Committee indicating that they have read the draft Doctoral proposal, confirm that it constitutes a sufficient basis for a PhD dissertation, as well as their approval to bypass the MS Degree;
- A copy of the M.S. thesis proposal;
- A draft doctoral dissertation research proposal that outlines each chapter of the Ph.D. dissertation, including methods, likely outcomes and significance.  Importantly, this must demonstrate that the proposed body of proposed work would satisfy the requirements for a Ph.D. degree This will not be the final dissertation proposal that will later be defended for the General Examination – you will still be expected to submit a formal dissertation proposal after your bypass application has been accepted;
- Copy of a paper accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal; a manuscript that has been submitted (or deemed submittable) to a journal may also be acceptable, in which case letters from at least two MS committee members indicating that the manuscript is scientifically rigorous and publishable are required
