# Boats

The Coop Unit has a few boats that are available only to unit employees, students, and post-docs. **Note**: before you can use or even ride in them, you'll need to fill out a federal volunteer form. Verna can help you with this.

## Training

Before you can drive any of the boats, you need to complete both the [Washington State Boater Education course](https://parks.state.wa.us/442/Mandatory-Boater-Education) and the [USGS Motorboat Operator Certification Course (MOCC)](https://water.usgs.gov/admin/memo/policy/wrdpolicy96.25.html).
