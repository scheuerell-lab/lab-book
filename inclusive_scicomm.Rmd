[Dr. Sunshine Menezes](https://metcalfinstitute.org/meet/sunshine-menezes/), executive director of the Metcalf Institute at the Univeristy of Rhode Island, has put together a list of resources related to inclusive science communication, which you can find [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1g7uXZzsC1QBCZWz4cRsERyzf6CrLKVXyLM_MTqvxK4A/edit?amp;urp=gmail_link).

The Metcalf Institute also sponsors a [biennial symposium](https://inclusivescicomm.org/symposia/) on Inclusive SciComm that may be of interest to members of the lab.
