## Food Pantry

No student should ever have to choose between buying food or textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at **no cost**. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days' worth of supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the [**Any Hungry Husky website**](https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky) for additional information, including operating hours and additional food support resources.
