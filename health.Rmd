# Health & well-being

Your health and well-being are of paramount importance. For a broad range of resources and assistance at UW, please see the [**Husky Health & Well-Being website**](https://wellbeing.uw.edu/).

**If you are experiencing a life-threatening emergency, please dial 911**.  

## Health insurance

Academic student employees (ASEs) receive health insurance through the [Graduate Appointee Insurance Program (GAIP)](https://hr.uw.edu/benefits/insurance/health/graduate-appointees-options/). GAIP covers medical, vision, and dental care for teaching assistants, research assistants, tutors, predoctoral researchers, and other ASEs working across the University.

GAIP benefits are negotiated between the UW and United Auto Workers (representing students at UW) on a three-year basis. The benefits are administered by LifeWise, a health insurance company based in the Pacific Northwest.

### Eligibility

The UW pays for your GAIP coverage if you hold an eligible job appointment and meet all these requirements:

* You enroll for at least 10 credits during the quarter

* You’re position is at least 50% full-time equivalent

* You’re paid on at least five of the six pay days of the coverage period

* You register for classes by the 10th day of each quarter

This eligibility criteria applies to the fall, winter, and spring quarters. If you remain eligible throughout these three quarters, you’ll automatically receive summer quarter coverage.

### Enrollment

You don't need to enroll yourself in GAIP. Instead, your eligibility is established when your department enters your employment information into Workday. However, to avoid any coverage delays, you should contact your department and verify your employment information was entered into Workday if you haven't received enrollment confirmation.

Once enrolled, you'll receive an enrollment confirmation email from LifeWise, the plan administrator. Please make sure to read all the GAIP information you receive as it contains important information about the GAIP plan.

## Food Pantry

No student should ever have to choose between buying food or textbooks. The UW Food Pantry helps mitigate the social and academic effects of campus food insecurity. They aim to lessen the financial burden of purchasing food by providing students access to shelf-stable groceries, seasonal fresh produce, and hygiene products at **no cost**. Students can expect to receive 4 to 5 days' worth of supplemental food support when they visit the Pantry, located on the north side of Poplar Hall at the corner of NE 41<sup>st</sup> St and Brooklyn Ave NE. Visit the [**Any Hungry Husky website**](https://uw.edu/anyhungryhusky) for additional information, including operating hours and additional food support resources.
