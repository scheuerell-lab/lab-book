# Communication

Communication is a critical component of science, whether it be through formal and informal publications, seminars, conference presentations, or a quick chat in the hall. Sharing our information with others and learning from one another are necessary for us to advance our collective knowledge.

Our lab relies on several forms of communication, each with its own pros and cons. First and foremost, Mark maintains an "open door" policy when he's in his office. If the door is wide open, please come on in. If the door is open just a crack, please knock, as Mark may be on the phone or meeting with someone else. If the door is closed, please assume that either Mark does not want to be bothered or that he's out of the office.

## Slack

We use [**Slack**](https://scheuerell-lab.slack.com) as our primary mode of communication in the lab, as it helps to keep our email more manageable while providing a simple means for categorizing, archiving, and searching prior content.

## GitHub

We use the Issues feature in GitHub when communicating inside and outside of the lab with our project collaborators. We also use GitHub for creating and editing our [**agendas for lab meetings**](https://github.com/scheuerell-lab/lab-meeting).

## Email

Email is a tried and true means for communicating inside and outside of the lab, in particular if the conversation involves people outside of the lab or you need to send attachments (e.g., draft manuscript, forms for signatures).
