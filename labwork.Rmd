# In the lab

[ more info coming soon ]

## General etiquette and advice

-	With the exception of standard household cleaning supplies (windex, all purpose cleaner, soap etc) all chemicals should be stored in the fume hood, or in the chemical storage under the fume hood.

- In order to help keep the fume hood relatively unobstructed: only chemicals that are being used should be in the actual fume hood, with storage of extra supplies under the hood in the cabinets.

-	Wash all equipment that has been used and leave out to dry. 

-	Keep lab counter spaces clear of clutter. 

-	Follow this general guideline: ”leave it as clean or cleaner than you found it”

-	Unless otherwise marked, all supplies and equipment in the lab are communal

-	Never store samples or chemicals outside of the lab.

-	All samples placed in the freezer should be labeled with a date, sample contents, and name of project or person responsible.


## Eyewash

During times when the lab is used regularly, we must flush the eyewash system with 10 gallons of water _every week_. There is a dedicated and marked 5-gallon bucket on the floor next to the eyewash. To flush the system, make sure the bucket is under the white drain pipe and then gently push the activation lever until water starts coming out both holes and drains into the bucket. When the bucket is nearly full, turn off the water by pulling back on the lever and then empty the bucket into the sink. Repeat the process a second time and then record the date and your initials on the sheet in the rack near the microscope.


## Chemicals

Mark maintains a chemical inventory and tracks it with MyChem.

### Flammables

All flammable chemicals must be kept inside the dedicated flammable cabinet under the fume hood.
