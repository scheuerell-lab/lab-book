# In the lab

[ more info coming soon ]

## General etiquette and advice

-	With the exception of standard household cleaning supplies (windex, all purpose cleaner, soap etc) all chemicals should be stored in the fume hood, or in the chemical storage under the fume hood.

- In order to help keep the fume hood relatively unobstructed: only chemicals that are being used should be in the actual fume hood, with storage of extra supplies under the hood in the cabinets.

-	Wash all equipment that has been used and leave out to dry. 

-	Keep lab counter spaces clear of clutter. 

-	Follow this general guideline: ”leave it as clean or cleaner than you found it”

-	Unless otherwise marked, all supplies and equipment in the lab are communal

-	Never store samples or chemicals outside of the lab.

-	All samples placed in the freezer should be labeled with a date, sample contents, and name of project or person responsible.
