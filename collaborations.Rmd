# Collaborations

<br>

Collaborative science is a hallmark of the Scheuerell Lab and as such, it's important to establish some ground rules when working with others. In so doing, there are generally three types of objectives:

1) Your needs as an individual (eg, professional advancement, mental health);

2) Project objectives (eg, preserving project timeline, producing all project deliverables);

3) Team cohesion (eg, preserve team harmony, preserve relationships with specific members that you will likely work with again).

Each of these may be top priority at different times or in different types of conflict, but be aware of which one you (and other team members) are prioritizing and which, if any, are being deprioritized.
