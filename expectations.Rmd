# Expectations

People in the Applied Ecology Lab are expected to be good citizens, neighbors, and office/lab mates. Please try your best to act in a manner consistent with our [Code of Conduct](https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book/code-of-conduct.html).

## Mark's role

Mark is here to serve as a mentor and source of information about academics, research, service, and life in general. He will do his best to help everyone get the most out of their experience at SAFS and UW. As such, Mark will push you to be your best self, which may include some uncomfortable conversations on occasion. Maintaining open and clear lines of communication will be paramount to our successful mentor/mentee relationship. It's important that students, postdocs, and technicians feel empowered to express their opinions without fear of reprisal.

Mark also recognizes that his socio-economic background and upbringing have shielded him from many of the challenges and injustices in the world. Although Mark is committed to helping you find the resources and information you need, he's also cisgendered, straight, and white, which means some of you may want to seek advice from others inside or outside of SAFS. And that's totally OK.

### Some things to expect from Mark

* Mark will strive to be impartial in his dealings with all lab members and create a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere to facilitate learning and excellence.

* Mark will endeavor to be clear in his advice and feedback to you.

* Mark will help you select a thesis topic and plan your research, which includes advice on possible supervisory committee members and courses that will help you now as well as in your future career.

* Mark will monitor your progress towards your academic and professional goals and provide feedback intended to help you achieve those goals.

* Mark will respond to any requests for help and meetings within 24 hours (except in exceptional circumstances).

* Mark will keep you informed regarding your current funding and will work with you to find future funding.

* Mark will provide career advice and help you expand your professional network. 

* Mark will assist you in finding a position following the completion of your program, which includes writing honest letters of recommendation on your behalf.

## Work hours

Everyone is expected to finish their tasks on time, but there are no fixed hours when people are expected to be working in the office, lab, or remote location. That said, there will indeed be times when you are expected to be somewhere at a certain time, whether it be for a meeting, seminar, or lab/field work. Please be considerate of other people's time and do not make them wait for you or wonder where you are. If something should come up, please contact others to let them know your status.

In general, Mark tries to maintain core hours at SAFS from 10:00-4:00 each weekday, so that people can interact with him on an *ad hoc* basis. When Mark knows he will be away due to travel or other business, he will do his best to alert the lab prior to his absence. If you cannot find Mark in his office, please send him a message via Slack, email, or text message (if urgent or an emergency).

If you are funded as an RA or TA, you are expected to work on the research program funding you, or the class to which you have been assigned, for 20 hours per week. You are expected to spend another 20 hours per week working on your own research, coursework, outreach, etc. "Side projects" are encouraged, but they should be considered part of your own 20 hours of research/studies, and not your RA or TA responsibilities. Your highest priorities are completing the tasks related to your TA/RA work and making progress towards completing your degree.

## Grad students

Graduate school should be a rewarding experience, but it can be incredibly challenging at times. The resources provided here are meant to help you transition to a new phase in your life and get the most out of your time at the UW School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. Staying organized with respect to your personal obligations, coursework, research, and outreach will help you through the process.

As a new graduate student in our lab, you will be welcomed into a group of diverse individuals with varying interests. We support each other in our respective endeavors and celebrate our successes. You will have numerous opportunities to contribute to our research projects, develop lasting bonds to others within and outside the lab, and help us improve upon our ways.

### Some things Mark expects from you

* You will maintain a high level of professionalism, which includes acting ethically and behaving in a manner consistent with our lab's [Code of Conduct](https://scheuerell-lab.github.io/lab-book/code-of-conduct.html) and the [UW Student Conduct Code](https://www.washington.edu/admin/rules/policies/WAC/478-121TOC.html).

* You will ask Mark for clarification on anything that is unclear or confusing.

* You will know the requirements of your degree program, including important milestones such as coursework, committee formation, and proposal submission. 

* You will attend all relevant meetings and seminars, including lab meetings and one-on-one meetings with Mark.

* You will come prepared to any meetings we have, which includes a clear idea of the agenda or goals for the meeting.

* You will keep careful notes of your research and ensure that you research data and software is backed up. 

* You will keep me apprised of your academic progress.

* You will ensure that your supervisory committee is kept abreast of your research and you will organize meetings with your supervisory committee at least annually.

* You will carefully review my comments on drafts of your work (not simply “accept all”) and question me if a suggestion for a change is unclear or does not seem justified/appropriate.

* You will use your peer network to find and receive advice, to the extent possible.

### Mentoring plans

All grad students will develop a mentoring plan with assistance from Mark. This will be a "living document" that evolves over time according to the goals and needs of the student.

### Annual reviews

All grad students will undergo an annual review with Mark, which involves the following 3 steps, as outlined [here](https://fish.uw.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2020/06/GSAR.pdf):

1. Independent reports

    * Student and Advisor both complete Annual Review reports, which include a self assessment

2. Student / Advisor meeting

    * Meet to discuss independent review reports

    * Define specific goals for the next academic year including any planned exams

    * After meeting, the advisor will distribute both reports to Committee

3. Committee meeting

    * Meet to discuss independent reports or distribute them electronically

    * Revise and/or approve goals for next academic year

    * Committee discusses and completes the Annual Committee Meeting Report, and sends it to Student for a response

    * Advisor files completed Committee Report with SAFS


## Postdocs

Post-docs in our lab conduct independent research and serve as *ad hoc* advisors to undergraduate and graduate students. They are a useful source of information and can help students navigate difficult situations.
